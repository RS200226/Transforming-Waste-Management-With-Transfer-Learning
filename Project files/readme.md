Project files
We have completed the project and generated the required model.h5 file using the notebook Project file.ipynb. This file is essential for running the Flask web application.
However, since the model size exceeds GitHubâ€™s 25MB upload limit, we were unable to commit it directly to the repository. Therefore, we have uploaded the model.h5 file to Google Drive and shared the link below for your reference and access:
